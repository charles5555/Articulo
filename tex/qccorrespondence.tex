\section{Quantum–classical correspondence}\label{sec:qccorrespondence}

In sections \ref{sec:classical} and \ref{sec:quantum}, we saw that the variational
method can be applied to $H$-functionals, which correctly describes the behavior of
classical and quantum dilute gases, with regard to their respective time-evolution.
Both $H$-functionals defined in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:cHdef}) and
(\ref{eq:qHdef}) also recover the well-known distribution functions, either Maxwell-Boltzmann
for a classical gas, Fermi-Dirac for a Fermi gas, or Bose-Einstein for a Bose gas. Nevertheless,
the functionals (\ref{eq:cHdef}) and
(\ref{eq:qHdef}) are seemingly different, and in this section, we will show they are
related by the correspondence principle.

We start by arguing that, in equilibrium, it is straightforward to proof that
Eq.~(\ref{eq:qfneqtwo}) collapses
into Eq.~(\ref{eq:fbardef}) by taking the limit wherein the 
degeneration parameter $\xi\equiv\exp\big(-(\epsilon-\mu)/(k_BT)\big) \gg 1$.
Alternatively, a more general approach to show the quantum–classical correspondence
consists of analyzing the collapse from the quantum to the classical $H$-functionals
within the appropriated limit.
For the case treated here, this limit is $f_{nM} \approx 0$ for several reasons.
Systems at very low temperatures, in which the quantum effects cannot be ignored, are obviously excluded
from the current analysis. In systems at sufficiently high temperatures, the particles
occupy almost exclusively high-energy levels. 
Furthermore, the energy spectrum approaches a continuum, as is expected by taking the limit
$\hbar\to0$, and the number of particles per level is very close to zero.

Subsequently, we substitute $f_{nM}\approx0$ into Eq.~(\ref{eq:qHdef}) to obtain
%
\begin{equation}\label{h-quantic2}
    \mathcal{H}= \sum_{M=1}^{K} \sum_n
    \left[ f_{nM}(t)\ln \left(f_{nM}(t)\right)\right] \delta V_M
    =\sum_{M=1}^{K} \sum_n
    \left[ f_{M}(\epsilon_n,t) \ln \left( f_{M}(\epsilon_n,t)\right)\right] \delta V_M.
\end{equation}
%

Finally, the sum over the quantum energy levels can be replaced by an integral over the velocities
by invoking both the uncertainty principle and the fact that, for free particles, the continuum
energy spectrum
can be written as a function of the velocity. Hence the quantum $H$-functional
transforms, in the classical limit, to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qHclassLim}
    \mathcal{H}= \sum_{M=1}^{K}\int C'f_M(\vec v,t)\ln\big[C' f_M(\vec v,t)\big] d\vec v,
\end{equation}
%
where $C'$ collects the appropriate constants stemming from writing the energy spectrum as
a function of $\vec v$.
