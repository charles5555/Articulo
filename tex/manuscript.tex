% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{%
Starting from a functional, $\mathcal{H}$, defined in terms of non-homogeneous distribution
functions, alternative demonstrations of both classical and quantum H theorems are performed
\textit{via} a variational procedure. This functional describes the time evolution of out of
equilibrium classical or quantum gases, and it satisfies the condition $d\mathcal{H}/dt\leq0$. The
equality condition is attained when the system reaches the thermodynamic equilibrium, and in this
state -$\mathcal{H}$ becomes the entropy of an ideal  gas. Some properties of the functional
$\mathcal{H}$ are investigated, including its correct behavior according to the correspondence
principle. In addition, the relaxation of quantum gases towards equilibrium is explored, from which
a time-evolution equation is obtained. The novelty of the approach presented here is the
application of the variational method to a functional defined in terms of non-homogeneous
distribution functions, in $\mu$ and position-energy spaces respectively.%

The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text---for example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data are shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary Data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

\section{}
All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendices, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled, starting with ``A''---e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
