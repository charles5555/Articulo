\section{Classical scheme}\label{sec:classical}

Classical statistical mechanics is theoretically founded on the Boltzmann transport
equation and the hypo of molecular chaos. The fundamental connection
between the microscopic nature of matter and the phenomenological laws of thermodynamics
is the $H$-theorem.

\subsection{The Boltzmann transport equation}

From the Boltzmann kinetic theory of gases, the probability for a particle to be in a given
state of position and velocity at a time $t$,
$f(\vec r,\vec v,t)$ (\textit{aka} the distribution function), must satify
the transport equation (Eq.~(\ref{eq:transport}), below).
This equation is traditionally obtained by exploiting the volume-invariance of the $\mu$-space
(\textit{i.e.} the space formed by the direct product of position and velocity)
and considering that elastic collisions constitute the predominant mechanism
for exchanging energy among particles \cite{bib:huang}.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:transport}
	%\left(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial t}\right)_{\mathrm{coll}}=
  \left(
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\vec{v}_1 \cdot\nabla_{\vec r}
    +\frac{\vec{F}}{m}\cdot\nabla_{\vec v_1}
  \right)f_1=\int\mathrm{d}\Omega\int
    \mathrm{d}^{3}v_2\sigma(\Omega)|\vec{v}_1-\vec{v}_2|(f_2'f_1'-f_2f_1).
\end{equation}
%
In Eq. (\ref{eq:transport}), $\Omega$ is the solid angle, $\sigma$ is the
scattering cross section, $\vec F$ the
external force applied to the system, and $f_1$ and $f_2$ ($f'_1$ and $f'_2$) are the distribution
functions of particles 1 and 2, respectively, before (after) the collision.

Particle dynamics and external forces are described
by the left-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{eq:transport}), and the right-hand side
is derived considering binary collisions between particles and
the \textit{molecular chaos hypothesis}, \textit{i.e.} it is assumed that
the coordinates and velocities of the particles are not time-correlated.


%-------------------------
\subsection{H-theorem and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution}

The evolution of a dilute gas towards thermodynamic equilibrium is frequently
addressed by first defining the functional \cite{bib:tolman,bib:huang}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hfunctional}
   H=\int f(\vec{v},t) \ln f(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v.
\end{equation} 
%
Here, $f(\vec{v},t)$ is a homogeneous distribution function, \textit{i.e.}
$f$ is assumed to be independent of $\vec r$.
The functional $H$, originally introduced by Boltzmann in 1872,
describes a diluted gas, at temperature $T$, with a total energy $E$, a total
number of free classical particles $N$, and total volume $V$.

Subsequently, the time-evolution of the gas towards equilibrium is obtained through the
$H$-theorem. This theorem establishes that if $f(\vec{v},t)$ satisfies the Boltzmann
transport equation and the molecular chaos hypothesis is valid, then
$dH/dt\leq0$ in general, and if $dH/dt=0$, then the system is in the equilibrium state.
The $H$-theorem is proven by taking the time derivative
of Eq. (\ref{eq:hfunctional}) and using the Boltzmann transport equation
(\ref{eq:transport}) \cite{bib:huang}. The $H$-theorem fixes the direction of time-evolution
of systems in nature, which is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics; in fact,
$H$ can be associated with an entropy density.

On the other hand, considering a diluted gas in equilibrium (\textit{i.e.}
$(\partial f/\partial t)=0$),
with no applied external forces (\textit{i.e.} $f$ is independent of $\vec r$), 
it can be proven that the equilibrium distribution function obtained from
Eq.~(\ref{eq:transport}) is precisely the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution function. The proof of the above commences by finding the sufficient
condition for $f$ to render a null r.h.s. of Eq. (\ref{eq:transport}). Such an
$f$, which we denote here as $f_0$, must satisfy:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:neccondf0}
    f_0(\vec{v}'_2)f_0(\vec{v}'_1)- f_0(\vec{v}_2)f_0(\vec{v}_1)=0.
\end{equation}
%
Subsequently, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distrubution function can be obtained by
taking the logarithm to Eq.~(\ref{eq:neccondf0}), and exploiting mechanical
conserved quantities (see \cite[ch. 4.2]{bib:huang}).

%---------------------------
\subsection{Out of equilibrium, non-homogeneous distributions}

As we saw in the previous section,
the validity of the $H$-theorem relies significantly on assuming
that the distribution function is homogeneous and that the hypothesis of
molecular chaos is surmised. However, in order to consider systems whose
distribution functions are not necessarily homogeneous, which
allows for studying systems out of equilibrium,
we introduce a modified $H$ functional as follows.

The proposed functional, denoted as $H'$, describes a diluted gas occupying a volume, $V$,
divided into $K$ cells, which, without loss of generality,
have local identical volumes (\textit{i.e.} $\delta V_M = V/K,\ M=1,\,\dots\,,K$).
Each cell has its own local
$H$ functional, $H'_M$, and local homogeneous distribution function,
$f_{M}(\vec{v},t)$; local number of particles, $\mathcal{N}'_M$;
local temperature, $T_M$; and a local energy, $\mathcal{E}'_M$. As a whole, the system has a
global energy $E$, and a global number of free
classical particles $N$. The functional takes the form
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CH2}
   H'(t)=\sum_{M=1}^{K}\int f_M(\vec{v},t) \ln f_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v.
\end{equation}
%


The distribution functions, $\{f_M(\vec{v},t)\}$, depend implicitly on the position of the cells,
relative to the global system, and on the velocity
$\vec{v}$ and time $t$. In terms of $f_M(\vec{v},t)$ and the energy, $\epsilon(\vec{v})$, we have:
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
    H_M' & = &  \int f_M(\vec{v},t) \ln f_{M}(\vec{v},t)
      \mathrm{d}^{3}v \label{Hcell},\\
    \mathcal{N}_M' & = & \int f_{M}(\vec{v} ,t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v,\\
    \mathcal{E}_M' & = & \int f_{M}(\vec{v},t)\epsilon(\vec{v}) \mathrm{d}^{3}v.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
%
Notice that assuming local homogeneous distribution functions means that we are surmising the 
local equilibrium hypothesis. In addition, $f_{M}(\vec{v},t)$ must satisfy the following
microcanonical restrictions:
%
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:micro}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:micron}
    \sum_{M=1}^{K}\int f_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v =N
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:microe}
    \sum_{M=1}^{K}\int f_M(\vec{v},t)\epsilon(\vec{v})\mathrm{d}^3v=E.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%

If the complete system is in equilibrium, then the local number
of particles and the local
energy do not depend on the cell number, this is
%
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:eqNandE}
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{N}'_M=\mathcal{N}'\equiv \bar{\mathcal{N}}'
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
   \quad\mathcal{E}'_M=\mathcal{E}'\equiv\bar{\mathcal{E}}'.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
In Eqs. (\ref{eq:eqNandE}) the bar implies averaged properties over the complete system.

We can see that the functional (\ref{eq:CH2}) contains a non-homogeneous
distribution function but keeps the same form of the Boltzmann's $H$ functional.

Inspired by the Hamilton principle, $H'$ will be maximized with those
restrictions to obtain the equilibrium distribution function for a classical gas
using the Lagrange multipliers method obtaining
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\delta H'}{\delta f_J(\vec{v}')} & = & \sum_{M=1}^{K}\int
      \frac{\delta}{\delta f_J(\vec{v}')}\left[
        f_M(\vec{v})\ln f_M(\vec{v})
        \right]
       \mathrm{d}^3v -\sum_{M=1}^{K}\alpha_M\int
       	\frac{\delta f_M(\vec{v})}{\delta f_J(\vec{v}')}
      \mathrm{d}^3v\nonumber\\
    & & -\sum_{M=1}^{K}\beta_M\int\epsilon(\vec{v})
    	\frac{\delta f_M(\vec{v})}{\delta f_J(\vec{v}')}
      \mathrm{d}^3v \nonumber\\
    & = & \ln f_J(\vec{v}')+1-\alpha_J-\beta_J \epsilon(\vec{v}')=0.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Isolating the distribution function 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \ln f_J(\vec{v}') & = & \alpha_J+\beta_J \epsilon(\vec{v}')
       -1\quad\Rightarrow\quad f_J(\vec{v}')\\
    & = & e^{\alpha_J +\beta_J \epsilon(\vec{v}')-1}\nonumber\\
    & = & Ce^{\alpha_J+\beta_J \epsilon(\vec{v}') } \label{relacion1},
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $C$ is a constant. It is trivial that using the variational procedures we
obtain the form of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 

As $H'$ in equilibrium is proportional to entropy, it is trivial to think that
Lagrange multipliers do not depend on the position because of the system is in
equilibrium and consequently, the distribution function is homogeneous, that is
%
\begin{equation}
    f(\vec{v})=Ce^{\alpha+\beta \epsilon(\vec{v})}\equiv \bar{f}(\vec{v}).
\end{equation} 
%
The constant $C$ can be omitted defining the following $H$ functional
%
\begin{equation}
   H''(t)=\sum_{M=1}^{K}\int \left[f_M(\vec{v},t)
    \ln f_M(\vec{v},t)-f_M(\vec{v},t)\right]\mathrm{d}^3v  \label{CH3},
\end{equation}
%
but $\sum_{M=1}^{K} \int f_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v =N$ where $N$ is the
total particle number. As $N$ is a constant and any $H$ functional has sense
when we calculate its time derivative, this constant can be omitted. 

On the other hand, if the distribution function is spatial-homogeneous, $f_M$ does not depend on the cell number $M$, then we rewrite (\ref{eq:CH2}) as
%
\begin{equation}
    H'(t)=\int \sum_{M=1}^{K} [f(\vec{v},t)\ln f(\vec{v},t)] \mathrm{d}^{3}v
         = K\int  f(\vec{v},t) \ln f(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v= K H_{boltz}(t), 
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    H_{boltz}(t)=\int f(\vec{v},t) \ln f(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v.
\end{equation}
%
Besides, if we analyze the following expression
%
\begin{equation}
    \int Kf(\vec{v},t) \ln [Kf(\vec{v},t)] \mathrm{d}^{3}v = \int [(K\ln K)f(\vec{v},t) + Kf(\vec{v},t) \ln f(\vec{v},t)]\mathrm{d}^{3}v, \label{sum-h}
\end{equation}
%
we can observe if the number of particles in the $\mu$-space $f(\vec{v},t)$ is to big compare with the number of cells $P$, then the first term in (\ref{sum-h}) is negligible, and consequently, we conclude that
%
\begin{equation}
    \int f'(\vec{v},t) \ln f'(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v = K\int f(\vec{v},t) \ln f(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v; \ \ \ f'(\vec{v},t)= Kf(\vec{v},t). \label{aditive-property} 
\end{equation}
%
We obtained the additive property when we supposed the distribution function is
spatial-homogeneous.


To prove the Boltzmann's $H$-theorem (using (\ref{eq:CH2}) as functional), we need
to assume that the distribution function $f_M(\vec{v},t)$ must satisfy the
following assumptions:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item The local equilibrium hypothesis in each cell ($f_{M}$ must be
    spatial-homogeneous for each $M$).
  \item The non-homogeneous distribution function assumption in the total
    volume ($f_{M}$ must be different among all cells).
  \item The following restrictions
    %
    \begin{equation}\label{restrictionoutsideclassical}
      \int f_{M}(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v=
      \bar{\mathcal{N}}+\Delta_M(t); \ \ \ \ 
      \int f_{M}(\vec{v},t) \epsilon(\vec{v}) \mathrm{d}^{3}v=
      \bar{\mathcal{E}}+ \delta_M(t),
    \end{equation}
    %
    where $\bar {\mathcal{N}}$ and $\bar{\mathcal{E}}$ are
    the local particle number and the local energy in equilibrium
    %
    \begin{equation}
      \bar{\mathcal{N}}=
      \int \bar{f}(\vec{v}) \mathrm{d}^{3}v ; \quad
      \bar{\mathcal{E}}=
      \int \bar{f}(\vec{v})\epsilon(\vec{v}) \mathrm{d}^{3}v,
    \end{equation}
    %
    and $\Delta_M$, $\delta_M$ could be seen as a deviation from
    $\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ and $\bar{\mathcal{E}}$ respectively,
    with $\Delta_M(t)\ll\bar{\mathcal{N}}$ and
    $\delta_M(t)\ll\bar{\mathcal{E}}$.
\end{itemize} 
%
Those conditions described a system out of equilibrium but no so far from it,
that is a perturbed system and will suffer a \textit{relaxation process, i.e.}
The time evolution of a perturbated system to the equilibrium state.

It is important to remark that the quantities $\Delta_M$, $\delta_M$ are
sufficiently big to be different from fluctuations in the system but too small
such that the system is not far from the equilibrium state.  

Performing the derivative of (\ref{eq:CH2}) with respect to time, we obtain
%
\begin{equation}\label{dH1}
    \frac{dH'}{dt}=\sum_{M=1}^{K}\int\left[
      1+\ln f_M(\vec{v},t)
    \right]\dot f_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v.
\end{equation}
%
Using the first-order approximation
%
\begin{equation}\label{firstorder}
   f_{Mn}(\vec{v},t)=\bar{f}_{n}(\vec{v})(1+g_{Mn}(\vec{v},t)): \ \ \ 
   \bar{f}_{n}(\vec{v})\gg \bar{f}_{n}(\vec{v})|g_{Mn}(\vec{v},t)|,
\end{equation}
%
(\ref{dH1}) yields
%
\begin{equation}\label{dH1-1}
    \frac{dH'}{dt}=\sum_{M=1}^{K}\int\bar f(\vec{v}) \left[
      1+\ln \left\{
        \bar f(\vec{v})+\bar f(\vec{v})g_M(\vec{v},t)
      \right\}
    \right]\dot g_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v.
\end{equation}
%

We can approximate the logarithm function in (\ref{dH1-1}) to its first-order
Taylor series around $\bar f_n(\vec{v}) g_{nM}(\vec{v},t)=0$ 
%
\begin{equation}\label{lnapproximationclassical}
    \ln [\bar{f}(\vec{v})+\bar{f}(\vec{v}) g_{M}(\vec{v},t)] \approx
    \ln [\bar{f}(\vec{v})]+ g_{M}(\vec{v},t).
\end{equation}
%
With the previous approximation, (\ref{dH1-1}) obtains the following form 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{dH'}{dt}&=&\sum_{M=1}^{K} \int \bar f(\vec{v})\left[
      1+\ln \bar f(\vec{v})+g_M(\vec{v},t)
    \right]\dot g_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v,
\end{eqnarray}
%
using (\ref{relacion1}) with homogeneous multipliers
%
\begin{equation}\label{dH1-2}
    \frac{dH'}{dt} = \sum_{M=1}^{K}\int\bar f(\vec{v})\left[
      \alpha+\beta \epsilon(\vec{v})
    \right]\dot g_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v +\sum_{M=1}^{K}
    \int\bar f(\vec{v})g_M(\vec{v},t)\dot g_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v . \nonumber 
\end{equation}
%
On the other hand, we obtain from the restrictions the following expressions
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \int \bar{f}(\vec{v}) g_{M}(\vec{v},t) \mathrm{d}^{3}v=\Delta_M(t) \ \  &\Rightarrow&
    \ \  \int \bar{f}(\vec{v}) \dot{g}_{M}(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^{3}v=\dot{\Delta}_M(t), \nonumber \\
    \int  \bar{f}(\vec{v}) g_{M}(\vec{v},t)\epsilon(\vec{v}) \mathrm{d}^{3}v=\delta_M(t) \ \  &\Rightarrow&
    \ \  \int \bar{f}(\vec{v}) \dot{g}_{M}(\vec{v},t)\epsilon(\vec{v}) \mathrm{d}^{3}v=\dot{\delta}_M(t), \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
%
and as a consequence of $\sum_{M=1}^{K} \Delta_M(t) =\sum_{M=1}^{K} \delta_M(t) =0$,
we find
%
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{M=1}^{K} \dot{\Delta}_M(t)  =\sum_{M=1}^{K} \dot{\delta}_{M}(t) =0.
\end{equation}
%
Then using the previous result to (\ref{dH1-2}), we find
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dH'}{dt} = \sum_{M=1}^{K}\int\bar f(\vec{v})g_M(\vec{v},t)\dot g_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v.
\end{equation}
%
Now, the summation over $M$ will be expressed in two summations
%
\begin{equation}\label{classicalH3}
    \frac{dH'}{dt}=\sum_J^{L}\int
      \bar f(\vec{v})g_J^{+}(\vec{v},t)\dot g_J^{+}(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v
      +\sum_J^{P}\int
        \bar f(\vec{v})g_J^{-}(\vec{v},t)\dot g_J^{-}(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v.
\end{equation}
%
where $L+P=K$. The group of $L$ cells is such that cells have an excess of
particles or/and energy (from the mean value in equilibrium). In contrast,
the group of $P$ cells is such that cells have to miss particles or/and energy
(from the mean value in equilibrium). Besides, $\dot{g}^{+}_{J}$ represents the
change on the deviation on cells that have an excess of particles or energy
while $\dot{g}^{-}_{J}$  represents the change on the deviations on cells that
have missing particles or energy. 
On the other hand, $g^{+}_{J}$  represents the value of the deviation on cells
that have an excess of particles or energy. In contrast, $g^{-}_{J}$ represents
the value of the deviation on cells that have missing particles or energy.

Also, on the one hand, $\dot{g}^{+}_{J}<0$ describes the loss of particles
and/or energy and so, $g^{+}_{J}>0$. On the other hand, $\dot{g}^{-}_{J}>0$
describes the gain of particles and/or energy and therefore $g^{-}_{J}<0$. 

We sort the previous ideas in the following form
%
\begin{equation}\label{separacionclassical}
\begin{array}{rl}
  g^{+}_{J}=+|g^{+}_{J}|; & \dot{g}^{+}_{J}=-|\dot{g}^{+}_{J}|,\\
  g^{-}_{J}=-|g^{-}_{J}|; & \dot{g}^{-}_{J}=+|\dot{g}^{-}_{J}|,
 \end{array}
\end{equation}
%
and consequently, (\ref{classicalH3}) obtains the following form
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dH'}{dt}=-\left[
      \sum_J^{L}\int\bar f(\vec{v})|g_J^{+}(\vec{v},t)|
        |\dot g_J^{+}(\vec{v},t)|\mathrm{d}^3v
      +\sum_J^{P}\int\bar f(\vec{v})|g_J^{-}(\vec{v},t)|
      |\dot g_J^{-}(\vec{v},t)|\mathrm{d}^3v 
    \right]. \label{classicalH4}
\end{equation}
%
We can observe that $\bar{f}(\vec{v})$ in (\ref{classicalH4}) is always
positive. Also the deviation and its derivative are positive, then all the
expression is positive. However, the global sign makes the derivative of the
$H'$ with respect to time is always less to zero. With this we proved that
$\frac{dH'}{dt}<0$. If the system is in equilibrium,
$g_{J}(\vec{v},t)=\dot g_J(\vec{v},t)=0$, therefore $\frac{dH'}{dt}=0$.

Joining both results, we can say the following statement:
Consider a classical gas in a total volume $V$ (divided in $K$ cells of equal
volume elements), total energy $E$ and total number of free particles $N$.
Consider also the system has inhomogeneities and suffers a relaxation process.
If we define the following functional
%
\begin{equation}\label{CH3}
   H'(t)=\sum_{M=1}^{K}\int f_M(\vec{v},t) \ln f_M(\vec{v},t)\mathrm{d}^3v,
\end{equation}
%
where $f_M(\vec{v},t)$ is the local distribution function of each cell in the
system, then in the first-order approximation
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dH'}{dt} \leq 0.
\end{equation}
%
This statement will be the classical $H$-theorem with inhomogeneities.

In the next section, we present a proposal quantum version of the
$H$-theorem defined by Tolman and our proposal quantum version of the $H$
theorem applying the method of the volume divided into cells.
